# Object-Detection
## Description
Object detection in images combines classification and object localisation tasks.
In short, training the NN model over set of images to detect instances of objects of various categories in an image.
## Algorithms used-
1. Sliding window technique(two stage detector improved with implementation of overfeat paper)
2. YOLO unified v1 algorithm(one stage detector)
3. Image segmentation (using U-Net architecture)
